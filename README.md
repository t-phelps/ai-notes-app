Spring Boot Backend Setup with JWT auth and Custom Spring Security

project is for future forks to reduce setup time

Changes requried after fork:
  1. pom.xml needs database username, password, and link to db updated
  2. possibly will have to change driver if not using Postgres
  3. application.properties will also need database information
